### What's this?
This repo was created for the purpose of adding the Vietnamese language, which is not in the game and probably never will be.

I'm just a translator, so all the work in this repo belongs to [lonqie](https://github.com/lonqie), the owner of this [Schale DB](https://github.com/lonqie/SchaleDB) project.
